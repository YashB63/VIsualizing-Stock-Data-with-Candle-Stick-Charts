# Visualizing-Stock-Data-with-Candle-Stick-Charts
Visualizing stock data with candlestick charts is a popular technique used by traders and investors to analyze and interpret the price movement of a financial asset, such as stocks, over a given period of time.

Each candle on a candlestick chart contains four key data points: the opening price, the closing price, the highest price (also known as the high), and the lowest price (also known as the low) for the given time period. 

The candlestick's body represents the price range between the opening and closing prices, while lines (called "wicks" or "shadows") extend from the body and indicate the high and low prices.
